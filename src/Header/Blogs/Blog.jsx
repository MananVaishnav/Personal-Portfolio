              <p className='first-p'>Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. 
                It focuses on both aesthetics and functionality, aiming to create a seamless user experience (UX) while ensuring a visually appealing interface.

              <h2 className='sec-2-heading'>Key Elements of a Great Web Design</h2>

              <div className="web-elements">
                <h2>1. User-Centric Design</h2>
                <span>Your users should always be the priority. Understand their needs, behaviors, and preferences. 
                  Tools like user personas and journey mapping can help tailor the design to your target audience.
                </span>

                <h2>2. Responsive Design</h2>
                <span>With mobile traffic surpassing desktop usage, responsive design isn’t optional. 
                  Websites must look and function flawlessly across all devices and screen sizes.
                </span>

                <h2>3. Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <span>Effective use of fonts, colors, and layout guides users’ attention to the most important elements 
                For example, a bold headline and a contrasting call-to-action (CTA) button can drive conversions.
                </span>

                <h2>4. Loading Speed</h2>
                <span>A beautiful website is meaningless if it takes forever to load. 
                  Compress images, optimize code, and use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to ensure speed.
                </span>

                <h2>5. Interactive Elements</h2>
                <span>Engaging animations, hover effects, and micro-interactions add life to a website, making it dynamic and memorable.
                </span>

                <h2>6. Consistency</h2>
                <span>Branding elements like color schemes, typography, and button styles should be consistent throughout the site. 
                This builds trust and reinforces brand identity.
